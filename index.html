      <h3>The Ties That Bind: NYC and the Spots that We Bind To</h3>
      <p> June 2, 2018</p>
      <p> This past summer I took a two-week photography intensive workshop at NYU. I studied under photojournalist Ron Haviv and editor Lauren Walsh. The theme of the class was “The Ties That Bind.” We were given creative freedom to interpret what that meant for our photo assignments. I interpreted it as the places that bind us to the city. I documented five of my friends and photographed them at places that tie them to the city. </p>

      <h3>March For Our Lives: Student-Led Protests Against Gun Violence Draw Hundreds of Thousands</h3>
      <p> March 24, 2018</p>
      <p>I covered the March for Our Lives: NYC for The Trace, an independent news publication dedicated to expanding coverage of guns in the United States. The article was a collaborative effort with other photographers from across the country who also covered the march. My photos appear about halfway down. </p>

            <p> Apr 18, 2017</p>
            <p>
    I worked on this article for National Transgender HIV Testing Day, which was on April 18. Our schools health service center offers the anti-HIV medication PrEP and PEP. The medications have been offered for only a year and I thought it was important we make students aware of that health services offer this medication.</p>

      <h3> The Stone Moves to The New School</h3>
      <p> May 11, 2017</p>
      <p>The Stone is a small music space in Alphabet City in NYC. This project was meant to capture reactions about the venue moving to The New School and provide information on the move. This was for my final project in my News Narrative and Design II class. We were given the task of covering a local news story. </p>

          <h3> Pizza</h3>
          <p> May 6, 2016</p>
          <p>This project was for my "Reporting Without Words," class. This class was a printmaking and journlaism class. We had to create an 8-part story using only images and no words. I hand carved eight 4X6 linoleum blocks to create my story which was about a local pizza shop that increased their dollar slices to $2 and then back to $1 after they started to lose buisness.</p>
